# Clean my macOS

Clean My macOS is built for modern macOS systems. It performs maintainance for mostly commonly used components in the core OS and third party tools with a single terminal command.

Clean My macOS uses a simple plugin system with all "cleaners" located in `~/.cleanmymac/cleaners` directory. Functionality can be added (or removed) by adding (or removing) files in the directory.

## Pre-requisites

You must have `brew` and `git` installed. You can use the cleaners that you need to or remove the ones that you do not want to use. Cleaners are located in the `~/.cleanmymac/cleaners` directory.

To install Homebrew open terminal and type

`$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

After installing Homebrew, you can install `git` by typing the following in the terminal

`$ brew install git`

## Installation

Open Terminal and type

`$ git clone https://github.com/aviral2552/cleanmymac.git && cd cleanmymac && ./install.sh`

Note: Clean My macOS is always installed in `~/.cleanmymac` directory

## Supported commands
